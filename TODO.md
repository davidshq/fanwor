# TODO

## Introduction

I asked Cursor what the biggest improvements to the current codebase would be. It suggested the following. Note that these are not necessarily the TODOs to be done or actually the most important, but perhaps a good jumping off point.

### Modernize the Graphics System
- The game currently uses basic bitmap graphics with fixed 32x32 pixel tiles
- Implementing a modern graphics system using SDL2 instead of SDL1.2 would allow for:
    - Hardware acceleration
    - Better scaling and resolution support
    - Modern visual effects
    - Support for different aspect ratios
### Improve Code Architecture
- The codebase appears to be a direct port from an Atari ST game with minimal restructuring
- Key improvements needed:
    - Implement proper object-oriented design
    - Separate game logic from rendering
    - Create a proper game state management system
    - Implement a component-based architecture for game entities
### Enhance Audio System
- Current audio system is basic with simple sound effects
- Improvements needed:
    - Modern audio engine using SDL2_mixer or OpenAL
    - Support for modern audio formats
    - Better music system with proper transitions
    - Spatial audio for better immersion
### Add Modern Game Features
- Save/Load system with proper state management
- Configuration system for graphics and audio settings
- Proper menu system with modern UI
- Controller support with proper input mapping
- Achievement system
- High score system
### Improve Build System:
- Current Makefile is basic and not very flexible
- Should implement:
    - CMake build system for better cross-platform support
    - Proper dependency management
    - Better version control
    - Automated testing framework
### Code Quality and Maintenance
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Implement unit tests
- Add documentation
- Modernize C code practices
- Remove platform-specific code that's no longer needed
### Performance Optimization
- Implement proper resource management
- Add level caching system
- Optimize rendering pipeline
- Add proper frame timing
### Security and Stability
- Add input validation
- Implement proper memory management
- Add crash reporting
- Secure file handling
### Cross-Platform Support
- Improve Linux support
- Add Windows support
- Add macOS support
- Consider mobile platforms
### Content Management
- Implement a proper asset management system
- Add support for modding
- Create a level editor
- Add support for custom graphics and sounds

These changes would transform the game from a basic port of an old Atari game into a modern, maintainable, and enjoyable game that could attract new players while maintaining its original charm. The most critical changes to implement first would be:

1. Modernizing the graphics system (SDL2)
2. Improving the code architecture
3. Enhancing the audio system

These three changes would provide the foundation for implementing the other improvements and would give the most immediate benefit to players.
